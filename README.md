~Welcome to Dark Flowering~

A Guided Sound Escape brought to you only in the DeroSphere….


Im your guide, Kalina Lux, and Ill be taking you on a restful journey alongside my flower companions starring some of the worlds most poisonous and 
dangerous flowers, and some sweet light hearted flowers as well.  

These journeys will take us deep into the darkest, hidden, caverns of our subconscious, where we may pull out weeds and plant fruitful seeds…

Together we will terraform our cosmicbiome, heal, rest, restore and rejuvenate when we need a time out~

In this intro journey, we will be working with Brugmansia~ the most poisonous flower in the world.  
Her medicine is potent, pure spell binding light, to purify and cast out all unwanted implantations and machinations of the deep unconscious.  
Her gift is electrifying white light, illumination all shadows.  

This escape is designed to give you an introduction into Dark Flowering.  So take this moment to build yourself a sacred space, 
where you wont be disturbed for the next hour or so.  Dim the lights, or get a blindfold… red and purple lights work best, avoiding any blue light.  
Next you may want to light a candle, some incense or some sage… or prepare yourself a luxurious cup of mugwort or lavender tea to enhance your visuals.  
Get a cozy spot in a chair, hammock, sitting in lotus position or curled up in bed… allow this space and time to be as nurturing as possible just for you… 

You’ve been working so hard, and just as one cannot always be inhaling all the time, one cannot be working all the time~ occasionally, 
we must allow ourselves to exhale in… But it is in this exhale that our most creative solutions spring forth from the cosmic void within.  

Without further pause, let us embark on our sacred rite….
